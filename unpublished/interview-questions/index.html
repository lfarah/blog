		<div class="wrapper"><h1>How to interview the interviewer</h1><p>On each interview we do and each new job we take, we see different problems that could be avoided if you asked a question during an interview. Let’s talk about what are my favorite questions to make on interviews. For every job I took in the past, none of the companies had 100% of the answers I wanted, but I had a lot of information to make a decision. In the end of the days, the pros just need to outweigh the cons.</p><h3>What is the number of people working in the mobile apps?</h3><p>What is the number of iOS developers? How many designers work with mobile specifically? How many QAs? Just general info that will help you have an idea of the profile of the company and how specialized the development will be.</p><h3>Tell me a little story about how an idea transforms into designs, tasks, PRs and deployment</h3><p>In case the interviewer haven’t said before, I want to know about the whole process of development, and most importantly, how much open are the product managers to their developers ideas., or if I’ll simply be a design to code translator. In this question, I’ll also learn about their methodology. Do they use scrum? How much of the scrum do they actually follow?</p><h3>Do you use Swiftlint? How about Fastlane? CI?</h3><p>The company gets a really special bonus if yes. Having a CI and SwiftLint shows signs of maturity. It gives me the first impression that the code is more organized and I won’t be having problems with force unwraps, at least. For the CI, where the company is actually releasing builds continuously, it shows me that the releases won’t carry that big, emotional weight.</p><h3>After testing their app... “Tell me about the section xyz works”</h3><p>Asking about a section of the app that I think it was hard to build and it is interesting, I’m generally interested in this answer because I will see how much I can learn by taking this job.</p><h3>Tell me about the backend. How is your relationship with the backend team?</h3><p>Does the app have to do many backend calls for a single button tap? Does the app have to clean information before sending to the backend? Filtering? - When the mobile team is just a user of the backend, the mobile developers suffer a lot. I have almost quit on so many projects just because of how the backend was making us mobile developer miserable. It is also such a good experience when the backend team is part of the conversation with mobile and we can all think of the best and fastest solution, making the least amount of backend calls and filtering.</p><h3>What has the team be working on in the past 2 weeks?</h3><p>I just want to know what will my nearest future will look like.</p><h3>What is the last time you had to work overtime and why?</h3><p>How does the company compensate for overtime? - I just had some really bad experiences working really long hours for weeks, so It’s been a couple years that I’ve been looking for a work/life balance.</p><h3>How does PR review work? What are the reasons for not approving a PR?</h3><p>It’s good to know how organized and defined is the code style.</p><h3>Does the company sponsor books, courses or conferences?</h3><p>This can be hard for smaller companies, but I bet they can at least pay for a couple books. I once couldn’t get my company to sponsor me for a conference, but at least they paid for my time while I wasn’t working while in the conference. Any type of sponsoring that shows that the company is interested in your development is a huge plus.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><blockquote><p>Talk about how good is to ask questions and how it shows that you're interested. Also say that I never hired anyone. I know from my experiences as someone looking for a job</p></blockquote></div>
